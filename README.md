# Python_for_Data_Science
Data Science is applied to gather multiple data sets to collect information and project the insight and interpret it to make an effective business decision.
However, being a data scientist requires you to learn some of the best and most highly used programming languages,
such as Java, C++, R, Python, etc. Among these, Python has been considered the preferred choice among data scientists throughout the globe. 
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data. 
It involves a combination of skills and knowledge from various fields such as statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain expertise.
The process of data science involves several steps, including data collection, cleaning, exploration, analysis, and interpretation. 
These steps are often iterative, and the process may be refined based on the results obtained.

###Tools In Python Libraries for Data Science:
1. Scientific Computing Libraries:
   
i) Pandas — It is a two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with a labeled axis.
   It offers data structures and tools for effective manipulation and analysis. It provides fast access to structured data.
   
ii) Numpy — It uses arrays for its inputs and outputs. It can be extended to objects for matrices.
    It allows developers to perform fast array processing with minor coding changes.

2. Visualization Libraries:
   
i) Matplotlib — It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications. Each pyplot function makes some changes to a figure.
  It creates a figure or plotting area in a figure plots some lines in a plotting area.
  
ii) Seaborn — It is used for making statistical graphics. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative graphics.
   It is very easy to generate in various plots such as heap maps, team series, and violin plots.

3. Algorithmic Libraries:
   
i) scikit-learn - It provides statistical modeling including regression, classification, and clustering. It is a free software machine learning library for Python programming.
   It uses NumPy for high-performance linear algebra and array operations. 

###Techniques in Data Science:

i) Regression- We use the regression technique in data science to predict continuous values.
            Some algorithms which we use in regression are linear regression and SVM regressor. 
            
ii) Classification- The classification technique is used in problems when we want to classify our dataset into two or more categories.
             Some of the algorithms we use for classification are  Logistic regression, SVM classifier, and Decision tree.
